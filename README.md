<b>UCEMR</b>
</br>
<i>A simple tool for ultra-conserved element genomic lab work.</i>
</p>

UCEMR is a simple command line application for ultra-conserved element (UCE) lab work. It is fast and required no dependencies. I created UCEMR for one simple reason: to avoid reaching my phone when performing UCE lab work. It is not an essential app, but it is nice to have while working in the lab. It provides calculator for making solution and a pre-defined timer for each protocol. I am planning to include lab manuals into the app. 

## Installation

Clone the project github repo to your computer.

```
git clone https://github.com/hhandika/uce-master-race.git
```

Using your shell, navigate to UCEMR folder and then type make to compile it.

```
# Change directory
cd uce-master-race/ucemr/

# Compiling
make
```
An executable will be created in a bin folder inside UCEMR folder.
```
bin/ucemr
```
